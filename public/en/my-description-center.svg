      Programmer since 2013, I started to work professionaly in 2020, developing games with Unity, where I opened my game studio and until 2022 I developed 16 team projects, copyright and third-party. I was also a writer for more than a year on the website crieseusjogos.com.br. After this period I started to dedicate to web development and today I work as a fulltack developer with react and node.
